====================
Single-Channel Image
====================

In fluorescence imaging, we work with single-channel images. A single channel image simply
means that each pixel has a single intensity value. In fluorescence images, each value represents
how much light (or fluorescence) was detected at that point. `This website <https://bioimagebook.github.io/chapters/3-fluorescence/1-formation_overview/formation_overview.html>`_
gives a very good simple explanation on how the light detected is transformed into pixels.

Grayscale
=========
A single channel image is also often referred to as a grayscale image.
A grayscale image simply maps the intensity values to shades of gray—from
black (0 intensity) to white (maximum intensity).

As an example, we will use this 100 × 100 pixel image, `blobs.jpeg`,
which shows, well, blobs. This image actually shows a magnified view of
lipid droplets in HeLa cells that I extracted from
`this image <https://biotium.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/LipidSpot-610-NucSpot-470-fix-perm-detail.gif>`_.

In this grayscale representation, every pixel's value is mapped onto
a scale from black to white. Black pixels have the lowest intensity,
and white pixels have the highest intensity. Intermediate values appear
as different shades of gray.

Other Representations of Single-Channel Images
==============================================
We can also replace the generally used grayscale gradient with a different
color gradient (colormap).

As you can see, not only can we assign different values to different
colors, but the general rule that *a larger value means a brighter pixel and a smaller value means a darker pixel*
also doesn't really apply to the above image representations.

In this case, the image can also be thought of as a heatmap. This is
often the case with scientific images. Because the regular grayscale
gradient cannot always represent the information we want to
show from an image data.

So it is up to the researchers to pick the appropriate representation.
